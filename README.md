# Ella
What can this A.I. assistant do for you? It can send emails for you. It can play music for you. It can do Wikipedia searches for you. It is capable of opening websites like Google, Youtube, etc., in a web browser. It is capable of opening your code editor or IDE with a single voice command.

Defining Speak Function The first and foremost thing for an A.I. assistant is that it should be able to speak. To make our Ella talk, we will make a function called speak(). This function will take audio as an argument, and then, it will pronounce it.
What is pyttsx3? A python library which will help us to convert text to speech. In short, it is a text-to-speech library. It works offline, and it is compatible with Python 2 as well the Python 3. Installation:

pip install pyttsx3 #in terminal
Install pypiwin32 by typing the below command in the terminal :

pip install pypiwin32. After successfully installing pyttsx3, import this module in your program.
Note: Do not forget to 'enable the less secure apps' feature in your Gmail account. Otherwise, the sendEmail function will not work properly.
